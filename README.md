##Translated Strings and Foreign Language Support

Foreign language support in JavaScript single-page web apps is hard.
JavaScript has no built-in support for translated string tables.

String tables are important because they are the primary way of
abstracting away text string resources from programming logic.
Decoupling that connection is important when crafting a web app
providing multiple languages.

Translation strings and foreign language support seems to be one
of those gritty boring subjects that no one writes about and plenty
of folks must implement. Searching through Google garnered me no
hits on this topic and I decided to have a go at writing this
article sharing my best practices. I hope this helps you when
you need a practical reference.

##Translated Strings and Foreign Language Support

Foreign language support in JavaScript single-page web apps is hard.
Unlike many development environments JavaScript has no built-in support
for translated string tables.

String tables are important because they are the primary way of
abstracting away text string resources from programming logic.
Decoupling that connection is important when crafting a web app
providing multiple languages.

Translation strings and foreign language support seems to be one of
those gritty boring subjects that no one writes about and plenty of
folks must implement. Searching through Google garnered me no hits
on this topic and I decided to have a go at writing this article
sharing my best practices. I hope this helps you when you need a
practical reference.
